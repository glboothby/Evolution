Evolution
=========

A simple model of evolution using colours.

Using coloured divs. The ones on the left are parents of the ones on the right.
Each new generation has a chance of mutating from its parents.
Predators will take out the new generation that most closely match their colour.
From the remaining children the ones closest to the breed colour will go on to be the new parents.
